# In the process of updating to work with Gnome Shell 3.4.14 
### It does not currently work...
Original script by [nanorepublica](https://github.com/nanorepublica/gnome-shell-stock-ticker)

This is a GNOME Shell extension that enables you to monitor the current share price of the any publically trading company on Google Finance.

###To install:
* Clone this repo
* Make the build script executable - `chmod +x build`
* `./build`

The build script just copies the files to the correct place (SVG files go to ~/.local/share/icons and the rest go in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/stock-ticker@akmiller.co.uk/)

It is possible to add new companies by entering the stock code in the text box on the menu or multiple companies separated by a comma.
